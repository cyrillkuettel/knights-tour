# knights-tour

I want to solve knights tour. This time in Java.  
  
This time I use the backtracking approach..  
The function should theoretically work for any n*n square board. However, if n is >10, it will take a long time.
## TODO:
- Implement a Priority Queue with Comparator. This should improve performance tremendously. The knight will then always jump to the square with the least number of onward moves. (Wandorffs rule)
